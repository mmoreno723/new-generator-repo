# new-generator-repo

## Description

This is a random password generator website. Once prompted by the alerts on the page, your password will be randomly generated based on the values you inputed. I was motivated to make this to show potential employers that I am well versed in javascript. I built this project to practice my JavaScript skills, including var statements, functions, alerts, prompts, and if and for conditions. 

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

  1. Open Terminal
  2. Make a new directory titled "new-generator-repo" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
  3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
  4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
  5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
  6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment
